# StockPricePrediction

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will
be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop
this project into two parts:

- First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
- Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

```
pip3 install dash
pip3 install dash-html-components
pip3 install dash-core-components
```

```
python3 stock_app.py
```
Stock price prediction is a machine learning project for beginners; a stock cost prediction model and how to build an interactive dashboard for stock analysis. stock market prediction using the LSTM model. OTOH, Plotly dash python framework for building dashboard.
